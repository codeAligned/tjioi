<h2 id="general-information">General information</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Will meals be provided?</strong><br />
We’ll provide pizza to all competitors for lunch. If you have dietary restrictions, let us know during the registration process, and we’ll make alternative arrangements for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Will you provide T-shirts?</strong><br />
Yes! We will provide T-shirts to all competitors and the coach. The cost is included in the registration fee.</li>
  <li><strong>What should I bring?</strong><br />
You should bring pencils and erasers to complete the written section. Computers will be provided for the programming section, so you don’t need to bring anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Do I need to have any prior experience?</strong><br />
Our competition is aimed towards high schoolers who have already taken a computer science class at their school, though there is no formal requirement. Additionally, we may use Java to provide code examples for the written section.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Is there a registration fee?</strong><br />
The registration fee is <strong>$50 per team</strong>. If the cost of attendance is prohibitive, we may be able to waive the fee; please email us at <a href="mailto:tjioiofficers@gmail.com">tjioiofficers@gmail.com</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Who will be able to participate?</strong><br />
Any high school or secondary school is invited to send students to TJ IOI, apart from TJHSST itself. Though our focus is on schools in Northern Virginia, schools from other jurisdictions are also welcome. All students on the team must attend the same school, and must be enrolled in the equivalent of grades 9-12.</li>
  <li><strong>How many people are on a team?</strong><br />
A team consists of four people. Each team must have one coach, who will chaperone the team.</li>
  <li><strong>How many teams can register?</strong><br />
We can guarantee a spot for the first two teams from a school, up to a cap of 27 teams. Any additional teams will be placed on a waitlist. We will only attempt to reserve a spot for your team once we receive your registration fee, and we will only cash your check once we have successfully reserved a spot.</li>
  <li><strong>Can I register as an individual or homeschool student?</strong><br />
If you are not part of a team, we may still be able to let you register. Please email us for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="programming-round">Programming round</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Allowed languages are C, C++, Java, and Python 3.</li>
  <li>Online documentation for these languages will be provided during the programming round.</li>
  <li>Each team will be given one computer to use, which we will provide.</li>
  <li>Contestants are not permitted to bring any personal electronic devices, including phones, flash drives, and keyboards.</li>
  <li>No access to the Internet, with the exception of the contest site, is permitted during the contest.</li>
  <li>However, you may bring printed materials with you to the contest. You will be allowed to use these materials during the programming round, but not the written round.</li>
  <li>We will give you time before the contest to familiarize yourselves with the computer configuration and grading system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="computer-configuration">Computer configuration</h3>

<p>This configuration is subject to change as we approach the competition, but this should be reasonably close to the actual configuration.</p>

  <li><em>IDEs:</em> Eclipse, jGRASP</li>

# Registration process
First, note that we will only reserve spots for up to two teams per school, and up to 27 teams in total.
We will only reserve a spot once you complete Part 1 below. Any teams without a reserved spot will be
placed on the waitlist.

## Part 1. Team registration

1.  First, complete the following registration form.
    **Make sure that you enter your email correctly,** as we will use it to contact you.
    We strongly prefer that a teacher or school official fill out the form.
    <p><a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" style="color: white" target="_blank"
        href="https://goo.gl/forms/A98asfYD1NKyzw642">Registration form</a></p>
2.  Once you submit the form, you will automatically receive an email with your responses
    and a link to edit your responses. You may update information for your team, including the
    team name or students, before the registration deadline.
3.  Next, send a check for the registration fee of $50, payable to TJHSST, addressed as follows:
    <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-body">
            TJHSST attn: Thomas Rudwick<br>
            6560 Braddock Road<br>
            Alexandria, VA 22312
        </div>
    </div>
4.  Once we receive your check, we will inform you via email. If we are able to do so, we will reserve a
    spot for your team if we are able to. If we are unable to, **we will not cash your check**, and your team
    will be placed on the waitlist.

## Part 2. Before the competition

1.  Have each student complete the Media Release Form (*to be posted shortly*). This can either be
    sent in the mail, or scanned and sent by e-mail. This is **required** to participate.
    Also make sure that your students complete any other forms required by your district.
2.  Ask your students to complete the student survey (*to be posted shortly*).
3.  When study materials are released, we encourage your students to review them to prepare for
    the competition! If your school has a **computer science club**, we encourage them to use our
    materials, and get in touch with us. If not, why not try to start one?

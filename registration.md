# Registration process

As of Monday, January 30, 2017, registration for TJ IOI 2017 is now open! Please register as soon as
possible, so that we can guarantee your team a spot. We hope you can come!

Note that we can only guarantee spots for the first two teams per school, and the first 27 teams overall.
For more details on registration limitations, see [the FAQ]({{ '/faq' | relative_url }}).

We will only reserve a spot once you complete Part 1 below. Any teams without a reserved spot will be
placed on the waitlist.


## Part 1. Team registration

1.  <p>First, complete the following registration form.
    <strong>Make sure that you enter your email correctly,</strong> as we will use it to contact you.
    We strongly prefer that a teacher or school official fill out the form.</p>
    <p><a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" style="color: white" target="_blank"
        href="https://goo.gl/forms/A98asfYD1NKyzw642">Registration form</a></p>
2.  <p>Once you submit the form, you will automatically receive an email with your responses
    and a link to edit your responses. You may update information for your team, including the
    team name or students, before the registration deadline.</p>
3.  <p>Next, send a check for the registration fee of $50, payable to TJHSST, addressed as follows:</p>
    <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-body">
            Attn: Thomas Rudwick<br>
            TJHSST<br>
            6560 Braddock Road<br>
            Alexandria, VA 22312
        </div>
    </div>
4.  <p>Once we receive your check, we will inform you via email. If we are able to do so, we will reserve a
    spot for your team. If we are unable to, your team will be placed on the waitlist.
    <em>We will not cash your check until we have reserved a spot for your team.</em></p>


## Part 2. Before the competition

1.  <p>Have each student complete the Media Release Form (<em>to be posted shortly</em>). This can either be
    sent in the mail, scanned and sent by e-mail, or brought in person. This is <strong>required</strong> to participate.
    Additionally, make sure that your students complete any other forms required by your school or school district.</p>
2.  <p>Ask your students to complete the student survey (<em>to be posted shortly</em>).</p>
3.  <p>After the registration deadline, if there are any changes to your team, notify us as soon as possible.</p>
4.  <p>When study materials are released, we encourage your students to review them to prepare for
    the competition! If your school has a <strong>computer science club</strong>, we'd love for them to
    take advantage of our materials. If not, why not try to start one? Either way, please keep in touch
    with us with how you're using our materials!</p>

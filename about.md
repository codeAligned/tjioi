### What is TJ IOI?
The Thomas Jefferson Intermediate Open in Informatics is a high school programming competition hosted by the Senior Computer Team at TJHSST. Each contestant will compete in a group of four and participate in the theoretical and programming rounds. The competition consists of a wide variety of problem difficulties suitable for both computer science beginners and veterans. Prizes and awards will be given to the highest scoring teams.

### Past Contests
The last TJ IOI was held on April 27, 2013. Since then, TJ IOI has gone on hiatus due to renovation. This year marks the third annual TJ IOI. Problems from previous contests can be found [here]({{ '/contest/' | relative_url }}).

### Purpose
Our purpose is to spread interest in computer science to high school students in the local area through challenging problems found beyond the classroom.

### Officers and School Sponsors
Currently, the primary faculty sponsor for TJ IOI is Mr. Rudwick. If you have questions about TJ IOI, you can contact the planning committee at [tjioiofficers@gmail.com](mailto:tjioiofficers@gmail.com).

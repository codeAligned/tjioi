### What is TJ IOI?
The Thomas Jefferson Intermediate Open in Informatics is a high school programming competition hosted by the Senior Computer Team at TJHSST. Each contestant will compete in a group of four and participate in the written and programming rounds. The competition consists of a wide variety of problem difficulties suitable for both computer science beginners and veterans. Prizes and awards will be given to the highest scoring teams.

### Past Contests
TJ IOI 2017 was held on May 13, 2017. Previously, TJ IOI had been held in 2012 and 2013, but was on hiatus afterwards due to TJHSST renovation. TJ IOI 2018 marks the fourth annual TJ IOI. Problems from previous contests can be found [here]({{ '/contest/' | relative_url }}).

### Purpose
Our purpose is to spread interest in computer science to high school students in the local area through challenging problems found beyond the classroom.

### Officers and School Sponsors
Currently, the primary faculty sponsor for TJ IOI is Ria Galanos. If you have questions about TJ IOI, you can contact the planning committee at [tjioiofficers@gmail.com](mailto:tjioiofficers@gmail.com).

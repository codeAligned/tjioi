# Contest information

TJ IOI consists of a written and a programming section.


## Current content

### Study materials

As of April 5, 2017, we've released our [2017 Study Guide (pdf)]({{ '/materials/2017/StudyGuide.pdf' | relative_url }}), which you can review to prepare for the competition. We apologize for the delay in releasing these materials, but we hope that they will be useful for you nonetheless.

### Written section

The written round is 1 hour long. Its purpose is to allow you and your team to explore a topic in computer science that you might be unfamiliar with, using paper and pencil. We won't tell you what that topic is until the day of the competition, though! To do well in this round, you'll need to be familiar with the material contained in the study guide.

We'll start the round by giving you some background information on a topic. You'll use this information to develop insights into specific problems, and different algorithmic approaches towards solving those problems. Then, we'll test your comprehension by asking you to answer questions, illustrate ideas, or develop informal proofs.

### Programming section

The programming round is 3 hours long, and it's more similar to what you might find at other programming competitions. It consists of 10 problems, which you will have three hours to solve by writing a program and submitting it to the grading server. The problems will test the material contained in the study guide, spanning a wide range of difficulty. So that you can get an idea of the kind of problems we'll have, we'll release a few sample problems as part of our study materials.

For technical information and rules, see the [FAQ]({{ '/faq/' | relative_url }}).
